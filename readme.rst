Extract Management 2.0 is a task scheduling tool for getting data from a source and depositing it in a destination - sql servers to SFTP servers.

Tasks can run at any time and on any schedule.

Possibilities are almost unlimited....

- Run .bat files on windows servers over ssh
- Read, modify and resend files over FPT or SFTP
- ZIP and send data
- Run raw python code to process data and send
- Run code from FTP/SFTP/SAMB or web source
- Send output data embeded or attached to email
- Parameterize sql on the project or task leve
- Parameterize file names with date parameters
- Export data as text, csv, excel, delimited, or as a blob
- Encrypt data before sending
- Pull and send data from FTP/SFTP/SAMB/SSH
- Run SSH commands to monitor remote servers

Documentation
-------------

Read the `documentation <https://docs.extract.management>`_.

Demo
----

Try out the `demo <https://demo.extract.management>`_!

Run with Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Or, you can run your own docker image:

.. code:: sh

    docker run -i -t -p 5003:5003 -e PORT=5003 -u 0 christopherpickering/extract_management:latest
    # access on http://localhost:5003


Run from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EM2 can be run locally. We use pyenv and poetry to manage the project dependencies. Assuming you will too -

.. code:: sh

    pyenv local 3.9.0
    poetry install

    # have you already created a database "em_web_dev" and updated the config files?
    FLASK_APP=em_web
    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade
    flask cli seed
    # if you want some basic demo information added
    flask cli seed_demo

Finally, to run the three site, you will need to run each command in a separate termimal session:

.. code:: sh

    FLASK_ENV=development && FLASK_DEBUG=1 && FLASK_APP=em_web && flask run
    FLASK_ENV=development && FLASK_DEBUG=1 && FLASK_APP=em_scheduler && flask run --port=5001
    FLASK_ENV=development && FLASK_DEBUG=1 && FLASK_APP=em_runner && flask run --port=5002
